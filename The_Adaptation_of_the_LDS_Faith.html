            <p><strong>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</strong>, sometimes referred to by their nickname <strong>The Mormons</strong>, has begun to subtlety change several doctrinal points in order to mesh better with the common Christian paradigm. These such changes include those which do not directly affect <em>Chapel Mormonism</em>, the concept of doctrine or phrases used or known by the common member. These distinct changes include changing the name of Sacrament Meeting<sup> <a href="https://local.churchofjesuschrist.org/en/us/va/annandale/3900-howard-street">[1]</a> </sup>, rewriting the introduction to The Book of Mormon<sup> <a href="https://wasmormon.org/a-new-book-of-mormon-introduction-tested-in-app/">[2]</a> </sup>, and gradually integrating the Christian Holy Week<sup> <a href="#">[3]</a> </sup>.</p><p></p><h2>The Name of Sacrament Meeting</h2><hr><p><strong>Sacrament Meeting</strong>, otherwise known simply as Sacrament, is a 1 hour procedure in which Deacons, young men from 12 onward, administer the Sacrament followed by 2-4 talks given by members of the laypeople. These talks are planned throughout the course of a week after notification from the presiding Bishop, or a member of his First Council. As of late 2024 the <em>COJCLDS</em> has renamed Sacrament Meeting on individual branch websites to <strong>Sunday Service</strong><sup> <a href="https://local.churchofjesuschrist.org/en/us/va/annandale/3900-howard-street">[1]</a> </sup>. This represents the cultural change from purposeful division from the Christian paradigm to a shift for better understanding. </p>

            <h2>Rewriting the BoM Introduction</h2><hr><p>The Book of Mormon temporarily received a new introduction of the Book of Mormon app designed for recent converts or those in stages of converting<sup> <a href="https://wasmormon.org/a-new-book-of-mormon-introduction-tested-in-app/">[2]</a> </sup>. This introduction featured predominantly standard Christian themes focusing on Jesus' love for every person while not going into detail about specific <em>COJCLDS</em> beliefs or practices. The original introduction featured comprehensive detail surrounding the writing and story of the Book of Mormon. </p><p><em>"One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C. and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians."</em><sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">[4]</a> </sup> </p>

            <p>This specific excerpt from the original introduction highlights the core fundamental storyline of the Book of Mormon which is not present in the rewritten introduction. Take this excerpt from the rewritten introduction concerning the writing of the Book of Mormon and its storyline.</p><p><em>"One such record was buried in a hillside in around A.D. 400 on the North American continent. Its location was revealed by an angel in 1823. It was translated into modern language by the gift and power of God. That record is the Book of Mormon."</em><sup> <a href="https://wasmormon.org/a-new-book-of-mormon-introduction-tested-in-app/">[2]</a> </sup></p><p>This is the most in depth look that the new introduction of the Book of Mormon covered about its timeline. The remainder of the new introduction focused on Heavenly Father's love for his children which emphasises the Christianization of the <em>COJCLDS</em>. This is so far removed from the original introduction written by Bruce R. McConkie that it no longer provides any real distinction of belief in order to prevent possible converts from wrapping themselves in the weeds of doctrine.</p><h2>Holy Week</h2><hr>

            <p>The celebration of Holy Week, which falls on the last week of Lent assuming the Gregorian calendar, is celebrated among several different Christian circles. This does to some extent include almost all Christians, however Catholics, Orthodox, and High Church Protestants are much more avid in the celebration than Low Church/Evangelical Christians. Mormons historically have not celebrated Holy Week. This is confirmed within the Church Topics and Questions guide. </p><p><em>"Latter-day Saints conduct Easter Sunday services but do not follow the religious observances of Ash Wednesday, Lent, or Holy Week."</em><sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/easter?lang=eng">[5]</a> </sup></p><p>This is completely contradictory to the current stance of the Church which now emphasizes Holy Week as a family celebration to be had. The Church clearly published a guide on how to </p><p><em>"Experience Jesus Christ’s Greater Love For You. Experience Holy Week.</em><sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/welcome/easter/holy-week-study-guide?lang=eng">[6]</a> </sup> </p><p>Which stands in staunch contradiction to the current published stance of the Church on Holy Week. This push is to emphasize the growing connection between faiths. This can be very clearly seen in the April 2025 Edition of the The Friend. In Margo and Paolo it says, </p><p><em>"It’s cool how we remember Jesus Christ the same way, even though our churches are different.</em>"<sup> <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2025/04/22-margo-and-paolo?lang=eng">[7]</a> </sup> </p><p>The context to this passage is a discussion about Sacrament versus Communion following their friend Julia's first communion. It clearly tries to focus only on the similarities while brushing their complete incongruity aside.</p></div></div>
